The following accommodations are proposed based on identified academic and behavioral opportunities:
	• Incorporation of Kinesthetic Learning Activities: Integrate movement-based learning strategies into math lessons to capitalize on [Student Name]'s athletic strengths. This could include using physical objects for counting and calculation, or creating games that involve movement to solve math problems.
		○ Train educators on incorporating physical activity into lessons in a way that enhances learning for all students.
		○ Regularly schedule math activities that require physical engagement, ensuring that these are clearly linked to learning objectives.
	• Clear Behavioral Expectations and Positive Reinforcement: Establish and maintain a classroom management plan that includes specific, positive strategies for managing behaviors. This should involve clear, consistent rules and the use of a reward system for adhering to these rules.
		○ Develop a visual chart of classroom rules and rewards that is easily accessible and referable during class.
		○ Implement a system of immediate positive reinforcement for desired behaviors, such as tokens or points that can be exchanged for privileges or rewards.
	• Targeted Small Group Instruction: Utilize small group settings to provide focused instruction in math, using hands-on, engaging methods that align with [Student Name]'s learning needs. This setting should also allow for peer interaction and cooperative learning.
		○ Organize small groups that rotate peers, fostering a cooperative and inclusive classroom environment.
		○ Break down math problems into manageable parts and use direct, hands-on materials to enhance understanding and retention.
	• Collaboration with Physical Education Staff: Work closely with physical education teachers to integrate physical activities with academic learning objectives, which can help in reinforcing math concepts through physical movement.
		○ Coordinate with the physical education department to align physical activities with current math topics.
		○ Plan monthly interdisciplinary activities that combine physical education and math objectives, promoting a holistic approach to learning.
	• Structured Peer Support: Pair [Student Name] with a peer mentor who excels in math and shows empathy and leadership qualities. This relationship can provide both academic support and a positive social model in the classroom.
		○ Establish a peer mentoring program that includes training for mentors on strategies to support their peers academically and socially.
		○ Monitor and adjust the pairing based on compatibility and progress, ensuring a beneficial relationship for both students.
